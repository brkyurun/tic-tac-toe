# Tic-Tac-Toe

Quite the challenge this one! It took me quite a long time to wrap my head around it until I decided to look up some more step-by-step instructions. Still, although very challenging, it was enjoyable.

## Resources Used

During the project, I have referred to the resources below for building the UI:

- Tailwind CSS color palette for designing a color theme: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
- MDI for SVG icons used in the UI and the favicon: [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)

## Features

- Built using HTML5, CSS3 and vaniila JavaScript.
- Enter your name and the second players name to start the battle!
- First player has the sign "X" while second player has the sign "O".
- Built with soft colors to not tire the eyes ðŸ¤“.
- Soft, minimal design language to enable the user to just focus on the content.
